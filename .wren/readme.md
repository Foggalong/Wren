# [Wren](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren)

These tools are made as part of the Wren blogging platform. Updating your blog with Wren is super easy:

  1. Write your blog content using your favourite word processor or text editor. Remember to check your spelling!

  2. Copy the content to the article section of the 'blog-new.html' file, convert the formatting to HTML, and check you're happy with how it looks by opening the file in your web browser of choice. Don't worry about the title for now, that's added later.

  3. Run the updater script

  4. The script will now prompt you for some meta data for your blog, such as the title and categories into which it falls.

  5. The script will then calculate the reading length of the blog and then add the meta data.

  6. Finally, the script will add the blog entry to the relevant category lists & feed.

And that's it! Thanks for using Wren :)
