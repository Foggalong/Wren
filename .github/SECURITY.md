At the moment I only have capacity to support the most recent version of Wren.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability please [email me](mailto:jfogg@duck.com) rather than opening an issue and I will respond and investigate as soon as possible. If it's safe to track the issue publicly I'll also open an issue on GitHub.
