# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Wren! Before starting, check the [licensing section of the README][licensing] and that you're happy making contributions under those terms.

Please note that the theme in this repo is mainly for my own personal website and at present I don't have capacity to turn it into a generic Jekyll theme. For that reason I may reject certain contributions if they're implementing features I don't want or that I would implement differently.

That said, I'd still love to see contributions! Just make sure your editor is using the [`.editorconfig`][editor-config], any changes to markdown are [markdownlint] compliant, and, of course, that it [builds][build].

[editor-config]: https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/.editorconfig
[markdownlint]: https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint
[build]: https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/build

This project strives to be usable with GitHub Pages. If your contribution includes bringing in a Gem which isn't [whitelisted][whitelist] make sure it's optional and fails gracefully when used there.
