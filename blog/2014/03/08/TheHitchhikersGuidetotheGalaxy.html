            <p><em>Read: 2nd-7th August 2013</em></p>

            <p>Just finished the book and my first thought was that I should have read it sooner. For about three years now it's been on my reading list and I should have just jumped it to the top. It's not really like any other book I've raid in its style and it was definitely a good one to end my reading hiatus with. Very funny but clever with it's humour too â€“ I'm certainly looking forward to reading the sequels.</p>

            <p>I'll probably leave some other books in-between them so that I don't finish the entire series in one go. I get the feeling it's going to be one I wish will go on forever.</p>
