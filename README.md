A lightweight blogging platform written in Python, licensed under the
GNU GPLv3+. It does categories, RSS, and estimated reading time, as well as
comments through Disqus.

**This is beta software. It may contain bugs; use at your own risk.**

You can read more at [the wiki](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/wiki),
but you're basically presented two ways to use it:

  1. As a stand-alone website
  2. Using GitHub pages and git

Each method has its own documentation and step-by-step walkthroughs, and
because Wren follows the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
principle each is super easy to use.
