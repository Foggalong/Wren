Wren
====

**This software is still under heavey development and so until this notice goes the latest release may not be usable.**

A lightweight blogging platform written in bash, licensed under the [GNU GPLv3+](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foggalong/Wren/master/.wren/license) You can read more at [the wiki](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/wiki) but you're basically presented four ways to use it:

  1.  As a stand-alone website
  2.  Alongside an existing website
  3.  Using GitHub pages and git
  4.  Using GitHub pages (web-only)

Each method has its own documentation and step-by-step walk throughs, and because Wren follows the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle each is super easy to use.
