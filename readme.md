# Wren

**This software is still under heavey development. It is not yet feature complete and may contain bugs. Use at your own risk.**

A lightweight blogging platform written in Python, licensed under the GNU GPLv3+. I was using a similar script to update my website and thought I'd go the extra mile and take it back a step and make it more general. You can read more at [the wiki](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/wiki) you're basically presented four ways to use it:

  1.  As a stand-alone website
  2.  Alongside an existing website
  3.  Using GitHub pages and git
  4.  Using GitHub pages (web-only)

Each method has its own documentation and step-by-step walk throughs, and because Wren follows the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle each is super easy to use.
