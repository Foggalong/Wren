Installers
=======

When using Wren you have 4 installation methods available:

	1.  As a stand-alone website
	2.  Alongside an existing website
	3.  Using GitHub pages and git
	4.  Using GitHub pages (web-only)

You can read more about these methods by clicking the above links to go through to their respective documentations, but the installer in this directory covers all 4. This repo is also home to the uninstall and upgrade scripts which are still in heavey development.
