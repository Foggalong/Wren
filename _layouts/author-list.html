{%comment%}
  Okay so hear me out. While Jekyll does have the site.authors variable,
  unlike with site.tags this isn't a list of all the authors across all
  posts which can be indexed into like site.tags["misc"]. Instead it's
  just just a variable (object or value) defined in the config file.

  At the same time, Liquid doesn't provide a way to directly initialise
  arbitrary arrays without a data file, and Jekyll can't generate or use
  data files without a plugin which GitHub pages doesn't support.

  All that together means to list posts by author we need to:

    1. loop over all the posts on the site and append authors to a
       string which at the end is split to create an array.

    2. loop over all the authors in that array and display a header for
       each. Within each author loop though we loop again over all the
       site posts. If the post contains the author in its post.authors,
       we display that post under the author's header. 

  It's more than a bit messy and would be a easier with a plugin, data
  file, or Paginate v2 collection, but in the absence of those it works.
