# Changelog

Wren versioning happens across all repos at the same time. That is, when a new version is released, for example v1.4, version 1.4 is released for the installer, for the documenation, and so on for every Wren code. The release notes for each repo will reflect what's new for that specific piece of the project, but this changelog will track all the changes with each version.

Throughout this point Wren was just a single script which I used to move files around for my website.
