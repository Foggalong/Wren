This install script is written specifically for Linux (in bash)
and so will not work with Windows. Installing on Windows is still
possible by manually changing the config values and moving any
needed files and/or directories. Regardless of your system, follow
the appropriate setup instructions below before running this file.

If you wish to install Wren as your whole website extract to your
web root (either through 'git clone' or archive extraction) the
source directory from http://github.com/Foggalong/wren

If you wish to install Wren alongside an existing website create
a 'blog' directory in the web root. Changing to the newly created
dir, extract (either through 'git clone' or archive extraction) the
source directory from http://github.com/Foggalong/wren

After doing either of the above you may run this file to fully
install Wren. Enjoy!
