        <p>My name is Joshua Fogg and I am 18 years old. I was born in Sheffield in the UK and have recently moved to Manchester where I am pursuing a Mathematics masters degree. I'm a Mathematician, Writer, Amateur Musician, Gamer and Computer Type - but not necessarily in that order.</p>

        <p>I guess the best way to describe me would be a nerd. Or a geek, or whatever the going word is these days. Though I don't subscribe to every part of nerd culture (as if that would even be possible) it is the category in which a lot of my interests fall: I was indeed in AV club, Glee Club and even the Chess Team.</p>

        <p>On a more serious note I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Until about three years ago I was all set to bundle myself off to film school and become a writer. Before that I wanted to do Special Effects and a multitude of other odd things. Since then I fell for the alluring mistress that is mathematics and have found myself wandering in the world of scientific academia.</p>

        <p>All these colourful (and not so colourful) aspects of myself need an outlet and I thought this was the perfect chance to give them one. The stories, the papers, the reviews and the blogs will all find them selves here - my own little slice of the internet pie. So welcome, old friends and new, to me. I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
