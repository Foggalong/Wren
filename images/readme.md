# Images

This folder contains all the images used by your blog. All the ones you use in posts are kept in the ```blog``` folder, and the remaining are used site wide and left for you to customise.

## background.png

This is the background image that will be used throughout your site. A good background will have the following properties:

  1. **Simple in design.** Overly complex backgrounds are very confusing for the user, distracting them from what you actually want them to read.
  2. **Distinct pallet, but not too colourful.** If the colours you use aren't distinct from your font your reader will have a hard time seeing the text on your site. Converselly, if the colours are too bright and garish they'll have the same problems.
  3. **Use a repeating pattern.** If your background uses a pattern, make it repeating so that the joins don't look terrible.


## blogtab.ico

This is the little icon that is used in the web browser tab while on your site. The recommended method for creating ```.ico``` files is to create them using an SVG editor like [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) and then export as ```ico``` when prompted.


## profile.jpg

This is your profile image, to be displayed on your about page. This can either be a photo of yourself or some other image that you use to identify yourself online.
