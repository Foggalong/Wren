# Images
Wren comes with various place holder images which can be swapped out for images of your choice. This readme simply provides some information on the images included.

### Background
The current background ([main.jpg](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/images/background/main.png))of Wren is just a modified version of a wallpaper I found online. I believe the original image ([old](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/images/background/old.png)) was unlicensed but I'll chase this up as soon as possible.

### Icons
The icons used throughout the website are designed around [Numix Square](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Numix-Square-icons-446392650) which is licensed under the closed source Numix License, but developed as a fork of [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) and so they are licensed under the GPLv3+.

### Navigation Icons
The navigation icons use symbols based from the Numix icon themes, and so are licensed under the GPLv3+.

### Profile
The default profile image ([profile.jpg](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/images/profile.jpg)) is of a Bewick Wren and was taken by [Minette Layne](http://www.flickr.com/photos/7232133@N08) and licensed under the Creative Commons.
