# Images
Wren comes with various place holder images which can be swapped out for images of your choice. This readme simply provides some information on the images included.

### Background
The background image displays titled so if you're replacing the default with one of your own it's a good idea to make sure that all 4 edges can wrap around.

The current background ([main.jpg](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/images/background/main.png)) of Wren is just a modified version of a wallpaper I found online. I believe the original image ([old](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/images/background/old.png)) was unlicensed but I'll chase this up as soon as possible.

### Icons
The icons are displayed at both 48px and 96px so if you're replacing the defaults with your own it's a good idea to make the size some multiple of 48px. It would also be recommended to use SVG as this allows them to scale nicely.

The icons used throughout the website are designed around [Numix Square](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Numix-Square-icons-446392650) which is licensed under the closed source Numix License, but developed as a fork of [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) and so they are licensed under the GPLv3+.

### Navigation Icons
The navigation icons are displayed at 24px in the navigation bar so if you're replacing the defaults with your own it's recommended to use some multiple of that size. It would also be recommended to use SVG as this allows them to scale nicely.

The navigation icons use symbols based from the Numix icon themes, and so are licensed under the GPLv3+.

### Profile
The profile image displays at a resolution of 250px by 250px so if you're replacing the default with one of your own it's a good idea to make it of that resolution or higher so it doesn't appear deformed.

The default profile image ([profile.jpg](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren/blob/master/images/profile.jpg)) is of a Bewick Wren and was taken by [Minette Layne](http://www.flickr.com/photos/7232133@N08) and licensed under the Creative Commons.
