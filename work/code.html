        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>I <em>really</em> enjoy programming. The only problem is I'm not especially experienced. I'm decent with Python and know enough Bash and Javascript to get by, but other than that my toolset is quite small. Because of that I try to do as much of it as possible, and in doing so there are a few projects of prominence that have come up.</p>

        <h2>Hardcode Fixer</h2>
        <p>A simple bash script which fixes hardcoded ixons in Linux distributions. While it's mostly my own work it's had key contributions from two other developers and collaboration from seven icon theme creators. <a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer">GitHub Source</a></p>
        
        <h2>ACTT</h2>
        <p>This is an open source implementation of the popular Nintendo game series Animal Crossing, written in Python using pyGame. This is not currently a functioning version, but there's an update I'm working on to make the transition from a text based game to a graphical game. <a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/Animal-Crossing-Text-Adventure">GitHub Source</a></p> 

        <h2>This website!</h2>
        <p>Before I made this website I knew nothing about making a website and so it's been a great learning experience. It's almost completely my own work, and written in HTML5 (with some PHP shortcuts) and CSS3.<a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/fogg.me.uk">GitHub Source</a></p>
