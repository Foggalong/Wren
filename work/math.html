        <h1>Math</h1>
        <p>I am a mathematics student at the University of Manchester studying for a integrated masters degree but in the past I did A Levels and in the future I hope to go to PhD and beyond. Throughout this time I've worked on various math projects and this is the place that these will be shared. Whether it be write ups of notes or papers on personal research, they'll be here for use of anyone that needs them.</p>
        
        <p>Obviously some University and research content will be private by demand and when this is the case it will be clearly stated. Sorry!</p>
