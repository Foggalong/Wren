        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>While design isn't my academic focus, it's technically a proffession that I work in and otherwise dabble</p>

        <h2>Numix</h2>
        <p>In an effort to better get to grips git, in March 2014 I started filing bug reports for various open source projects that I use. With one project in paticular, <a href="http://numixproject.org">Numix</a>, this quickly evolved from issue filing, to submitting patches, to launching <a href="http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Numix-Square-icons-446392650?offset=10#comments">Numix-Square</a> (a square version of their Circle theme), to eventually just becoming a member of the team.</p>

        <p>Now, as well as being the main maintainer for Square, I also help maintain the base theme, Circle, and have launched the symbol only theme Technic and the alternate folder. Outside of the design work, I also help with community management, system administration, and run the financial accounts.</p>

        <p>As a note, I also use the Numix Square icons around the site for navigation.</p>
