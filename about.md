![Photo of Me]({{ '/images/profile.jpg' | relative_url }}){: class="left" width="200px%" }

This is the personal website of me, {{ site.author.name }}!

You can use this space to write a bit about yourself, who you are, what you do, and what this blog is going to be used for. You can also add a profile image by replacing the Wren image in the images directory with on of your own.

You can also customise the contact links that are shown in the footer of every page to link to your own social networks; check `_config.yml` for more.
