		<article>
			<p>Given with the subtitle “Joshua Fogg in thirty songs”. In cleaning up some old online accounts (more on that another time) I stumbled across my first YouTube channel, what would now be called a “Let's Play”, under the name of “nintoad”. Ignoring the quality of the content I noticed a playlist of videos featured predominantly on the page entitled “This Is Me”. It linked up to a note I made on Facebook for the “30 Day Song Challenge” that was being passed around at the time. For archiving purposes (and because it makes me smile) I've reposted it here along with some comments on my thoughts now three years later. (As a note I haven't fixed YouTube links)</p>

			<h3>Day 01 - your favorite song</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIpXx9D_Uag">This Is Me – Charlie McDonnell</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> I love the song. I love him. Nuff said.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Did you not hear? Nuff said.But I</p><br>

			<h3>Day 02 - your least favorite song</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzfQwXEqYaI">Friday - Rebecca Black</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Rather than giving her the pleasure of getting more views, and dirty this post with such filth, here’s a nice short comedy take on something which is infinitely better, and will also prove educational if show to those ‘special few’ soon enough.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Damn I was a tough critic. To be fair, she seemed like a genuinely nice person and her subsequent releases were no where near as bad.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 03 - a song that makes you happy</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98P-gu_vMRc">Mr. Blue Sky – Electric Light Orchestra</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Love it so, so much! Always puts me in a brilliant mood no matter how I felt before.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Shortly after this I made the song my morning alarm clock. It quickly dropped of the 'happy' list.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 04 - a song that makes you sad</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVY9Q9GPY5Q">Doomsday – Murray Gold</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> So what if it’s a sound track? It brings a tear to my eye and a lump my throat every time.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> One reflection I think this is still the best song ever in Doctor Who.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 05 - a song that reminds you of someone</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqgXzPfAxjo">Common People – Pulp</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Not just someone, some people, and especially of a conversation I’ve had far too many times. Fail my arse.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Damn that was cocky. I stand by the basis of the idea it's really not something to point out to people.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 06 - a song that reminds you of somewhere</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y">Human – The Killers</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> ARE WE HUMAN (HELL NO!) OR ARE WE WRITERS (YEAH!)?<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Parody made on a writers retreat I went to. I can't thank <a href="https://twitter.com/thedannysmith">Danny</a> enough for introducing me to the Killers.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 07 - a song that reminds you of a certain event</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cINpA4sSzu0">Stardust – Michael Bublé (With Naturally Seven)</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Happy memories.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> My first slow dance. Brilliant clarinet solo too.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 08 - a song that you know all the words to</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxEPV4kolz0">Piano Man – Billy Joel</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> If I ever get the chance to sing this, I will.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I'll probably be drunk.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 09 - a song that you can dance to</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0">The Pokémon Theme Song – Jason Paige</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> With Spock and Cubone! One hell of a party! :P<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I went to some <s>weird</s> great parties.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 10 - a song that makes you fall asleep</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqvrn1hBbu0">Windmills of your mind – The Colourfield</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> But in a brilliant magical way. So nice and floaty...<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I think I first heard this in a Sky advert.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 11 - a song from your favorite band</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRTqhf2zi0k">Killer – The Hoosiers</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> One of their lesser known songs, but probably my favorites.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I was a hipster before it was cool.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 12 - a song from a band you hate</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qxUqwrNDA">The Promise – Girls Aloud</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Just so much no.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> ARGH. I'd forgotten how bad it was.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 13 - a song that is a guilty pleasure</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QIAv2EoIP0">Three Lions – The Lightening Seeds</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> What, so just because I don’t like football, I can’t like the songs? :P<br>
			<em>Now:</em> No Josh, no one said that.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 14 - a song that no one would expect you to love</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VurhzANQ_B0">A Little Piece Of Heaven – Avenged Sevenfold</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> I’ll admit it, I love it. Bass Clarinet bonus!<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Not such a big fan of this now. Necrophillia just doesn't bring the excitment it used to.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 15 - a song that describes you</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKpQCexEMRw">Rock ‘n’ Roll Nerd – Tim Minchin</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> If you want an accurate description of me, look at my favorite song. If not, this is a nice little comedy entry which doesn’t stray too far from the truth!<br>
			<em>Now:</em> The orchestral version of this is brilliant. Look it up if you haven't seen it. I think it's called "Cage Nerd" now.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 16 - a song that you used to love but now hate</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckpy0l5mAbg">Famous – Scouting for Girls</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Over played it, so leaving it alone for a while.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Still overplayed. I'll leave it a bit longer.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 17 - a song that you hear often on the radio</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObmXBy2IyaM">I Wish I was James Bond – Scouting For Girls</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Three times in one week! Not that I’m complaining.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Now there's a song I haven't heard in a while.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 18 - a song that you wish you heard on the radio</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRutX9B6NY">30 Pills – Lester Allen</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> A brilliant song, but sadly incredibly unknown. I love it. It’s probably my second favorite song.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> :(</p><br>

			<h3>Day 19 - a song from your favorite album</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAi4izfvXo4">An Awful Lot of Running to Do – Chameleon Circuit</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Probably not my favorite on the album, but sums up my very thoughts every time I watch Doctor Who.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I can't even listen to this song anymore. Fuck Alex Day.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 20 - a song that you listen to when you’re angry</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8KQmps-Sog">Uprising – Muse</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Really gets me going this one does. I’ll learn that bass line one day.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I should buy a bass.</p><br>
 
			<h3>Day 21 - a song that you listen to when you’re happy</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbfs5w8lSBo">I Can’t Decide – Scissor Sisters</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Just brilliant! Gives me a feeling of being in control like no other, and make me feel like I can do anything! :D<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I'd forgotten about this song. So much dancing.</p><br>
 
			<h3>Day 22 - a song that you listen to when you’re sad</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWiccrTB4LM">Love Today – MIKA</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Or any MIKA song to be fair. Puts me in a good mood afterwards you see.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I could learn a thing or too from past me.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 23 - a song that you want to play at your wedding</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdudKAMOz5s">How you Write a Love Song – Axis of Awesome</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Totally...I might even sing it... No, joking. I’m not really thinking about this at the moment :P<br>
			<em>Now:</em> See, past me had my head screwed on. Good job man. Now go back to playing Pokemon.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 24 - a song that you want to play at your funeral</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIiUqfxFttM">That’s Life – Frank Sinatra</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> How could I not? Much love for this song.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Wow funeral. Much love. So cry.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 25 - a song that makes you laugh</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yvEYKRF5IA">Boombox – Lonely Island</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> The shortened version, but worth it for the funny, if not slightly disgusting video.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Not as funny as I remember. Mostly just disgusting now.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 26 - a song that you can play on an instrument</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8YCSJpF4g4">5 Years Time – Noah and the Whale</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Not very well I’ll admit, but playing the ukulele and singing along puts me in a brilliant mood.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Three years later an my ukulele skills have barely budged.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 27 - a song that you wish you could play</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODXS9CL2BYw">I Can’t Believe You’re In Love With Me – The Anything Goes Orchestra</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> I’ll take either the ukulele or double bass part, I ain’t picky! :P<br>
			<em>Now:</em> Damn it man! Just buy that bass.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 28 - a song that makes you feel guilty</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eWi0YiLMPc">Clinging on for Life – The Hoosiers</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> Yeah, it does.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I have no idea why.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 29 - a song from your childhood</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwdmqM3pc68">The Lord of the Dance – Various, Hymn</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> On from those golden years, which now, looking back, were quite heavy with religion. Not that I minded, or even mind now. I also notice now that my primary school cut out the verse about the devil. Cotton wool and bubble wrap much. :P<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I've since played this with an orchestra - brilliant song. So much fun.</p><br>

			<h3>Day 30 - your favorite song at this time last year</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pu_bpqLZKI">Superman – Lazlo Bane</a><br>
			<em>Then:</em> More than just a theme tune, and a genuinely brilliant song.<br>
			<em>Now:</em> I think I overplayed this but the motto did a great deal to helping me through sixth form.</p>

			<p>So that's me. In thirty songs. Yeah.</p>

			<br>

			<p>So I've changed a fair bit more than I thought. I guess time capsles like this are good for showing that sort of thing.Also, I really need to buy that bass.</p>
