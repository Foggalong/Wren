ki! This is the go to place for all information, instructions and help regarding the Wren blogging platform.

### What is Wren?

When I started my own website I wanted to make as many of the technologies that I would be using as possible. One of these was a script I wrote to update my blog. As the script grew I decided it might be a good idea to generalise it so that it could easily be re-purposed for other uses. From this came Wren, a lightweight blogging platform that can be used by anyone.

### Instructions

What instructions you need depend on what set-up you wish to use Wren with:

* Alongside an existing website
* As a stand-alone website
* Using GitHub pages and git
* Using GitHub pages (web-only)
